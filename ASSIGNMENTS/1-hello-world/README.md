Create a new Folder

Open the Command Line (Terminal) and run this command:

npx create-next-app .
this will create a Next.Js project

The app directory is where you define routes, create UI and colocate files such as components, tests, or stylesheets.

Read the following React Documentation:

React Essentials

Note: Our file extension is not jsx but tsx because we are using TypeScript

In the app/page.tsx file delete the previous React component and replace it with the following simple hello world component:
export default function Home() {
  return (
        <div>Hello World</div>
  );
}
We wrote a very simple hello world React component in the file. Note that it is a convention in Next.js that the html page in the director is called page.tsx

Start the development Server:
npm run dev
